# Project Structure

## Overview

This document defines the directory structure of the KufMon project.

The project follows a layered architecture inspired by Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). Source code is organized by responsibility rather than by technology.

The primary goals are:

- clear separation of concerns;
- high testability;
- infrastructure independence;
- predictable growth;
- simple navigation.

---

# Layer Responsibilities

```
API

↓

Application

↓

Domain

↓

Infrastructure
```

Dependencies always point downward.

The Domain layer must not depend on any other project layer.

---

# api/

## Purpose

Presentation layer.

Responsible for HTTP communication only.

Business logic is prohibited.

```
api/

├── routes/
├── controllers/
├── dto/
├── middleware/
├── plugins/
├── validators/
└── schemas/
```

---

## routes/

Registers Fastify routes.

Example:

```
GET /health

GET /ads

POST /subscriptions
```

Routes call controllers only.

---

## controllers/

Translate HTTP requests into application service calls.

Responsibilities:

- validate input
- invoke use case
- convert response
- return HTTP status

Controllers never access the database directly.

---

## dto/

Request/response models.

Example:

```
CreateSubscriptionRequest

AdvertisementResponse

EventResponse
```

DTOs never appear in the Domain layer.

---

## middleware/

Fastify middleware.

Examples:

- logging
- authentication
- request id
- error handling

---

## plugins/

Fastify plugins.

Examples:

- Prisma
- Logger
- Configuration

---

## validators/

Request validation.

Recommended:

```
Zod
```

---

## schemas/

OpenAPI schemas.

Future expansion.

---

# application/

## Purpose

Application use cases.

Coordinates domain objects.

Contains no infrastructure details.

```
application/

├── services/
├── use-cases/
├── ports/
├── dto/
└── mappers/
```

---

## services/

High-level orchestration.

Separate from HTTP DTOs.

---

## mappers/

Transforms between:

- DTO
- Domain
- Infrastructure

---

# domain/

## Purpose

Core business logic.

Most important layer.

Contains no framework-specific code.

```
domain/

```
AdvertisementCreated

AdvertisementChanged

AdvertisementRemoved
```

---

## repositories/

Repository interfaces.

Example:

```
AdvertisementRepository

EventRepository

SubscriptionRepository
```

Only interfaces.

Implementation belongs to Infrastructure.

---

## services/

Pure domain services.

Example:

```
SnapshotComparer

AdvertisementDiffer
```

---

## policies/

Business rules.

Example:

```
RemovalPolicy

NotificationPolicy
```

---

AdvertisementRepository

SyncService

TelegramSender
```

Interfaces

```
MarketplaceClient

NotificationSender

Hasher
```

Files

```
sync-service.ts

telegram-sender.ts

advertisement.repository.ts

# Future Extensions

Future modules can be added without changing existing layers.

Examples:

```
infrastructure/

├── email/

├── redis/

├── queue/

└── metrics/
```

```
api/

├── graphql/

└── websocket/
```

The structure is intentionally extensible.

---

# Summary

The project structure emphasizes:

- Layered architecture
- Domain isolation
- Testability
- Infrastructure independence
- Predictable growth
- Clean separation of responsibilities

Each directory has a single, well-defined purpose, making the project easy to navigate, maintain, and extend.
